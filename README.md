### Folder Structure

- Each image used in an article resides in its **own folder** under `images/`:

```
images/
├── image_name_01/
│   ├── image.png          # screengrab or downloaded image
│   ├── url.txt            # URL of the source (e.g., Unsplash)
│   ├── license.txt        # License copy or notes
│   └── photographer.txt   # Optional, if known
```
To get the RAW url of a github image go to the image, right click and select "Copy Image Address"
